# Task Board Starter Code

Here is my Task Board Project!

* There are 3 columns to represent the progress state of a task - ToDo, In Progress, Done
* Tasks can be dragged and dropped between the columns
* When creating a task, there is a user-friendly modal that opens with a form to enter the task name, due date, and description
* The border of the created task will correspond to the due date
  * Red -> Overdue
  * Yellow -> Less than 3 Days Left
  * Green -> More than 3 Days Left
* Tasks are saved in local storage, so they will be visible even when you refresh the page!
* Deleting a task is easy, just click the delete button!
